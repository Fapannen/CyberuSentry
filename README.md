# CyberuSentry
Welcome to CyberuSentry! CyberuSentry is a mixture of 4 words which describe the nature of this project.
  - [Cyber](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cyber) - Involving, using, or relating to computers 
  - [Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus) - A three-headed guardian dog from the Greek mythology
  - [Sentry](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sentry) - A soldier who guards a place, usually by standing at its entrance
  - [Entry](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entry) - The act of entering a place

In this repository you can find the implementation for the CyberuSentry model. CyberuSentry is an ensemble of siamese neural networks
developed for the purpose of competing in the [UCCS Watchlist Challenge](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/challenge.html). 

The model placed **TODO FILL** in the challenge. FILL IN THAT IT WASNT EXPECTED TO PERFORM GODLIKE

# UCCS Watchlist Challenge
The task of this challenge, organized by the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), was to develop a model capable of solving open-set
face identification problem. There was also a part dedicated to face detection, though this part was not considered within this model and pre-trained
face detectors were used to facilitate work in this repository.

The competition started on March 1, 2024. I signed up after I found the competition was ongoing and my application was approved on March 22, 2024.
Deadline for submitting all the necessary files was June 1, 2024. Thus, I had less than six weeks to fulfil the assignment.

# Models
Since the UCCS Dataset is not public at the moment, models will not be released as every single one of them was trained using the private data.
Should the dataset become public in the future, I will reevaluate publishing the models again.
