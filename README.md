CyberuSentry is a mixture of 4 words which describe the nature of this project.

  - [Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus) - A three-headed guardian dog from the Greek mythology

CyberuSentry is a system that detects customer frauds in accomodation booking. When renting a place to stay, such as via AirBnb or Booking.com, the customers sometimes declare that X people will be staying
at the place, only to find out that there were actually Y people ( Y > X ) staying at the place. This results in financial loss for the renter, but it is difficult to prove that there were more people than
declared. CyberuSentry should serve as a tool to assess the amount of unique people that have visited the accomodation and help the renters provide a proof that the accomodation was used by more people than
originally declared.
